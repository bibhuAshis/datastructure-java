## Google Foobar Challenge:

I got an invitation to Google Foobar challenge on 28th April while searching for some java related stuff on google. I accepted the invitation and after requesting for a challenge I received "the cake is not a lie" challenge. I had 48 hours to solve the first challenge and I managed to solve it within 2 hours. I was asked to login to progress and after logging in, received challenges with increasing complexity and allowed time to solve at each level. 

I am updating the current folder with challenges that I received and the solutions I came up with. Currently I am at 2nd challenge of level 3.
